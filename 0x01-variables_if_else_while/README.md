    - You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)

9-print_comb.c: Write a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.

    - Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
    You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
    You are not allowed to use any variable of type char

100-print_comb3.cWrite a program that prints the numbers from 00 to 99.

    - You are not allowed to use any variable of type char
    - The two digits must be different
    - 01 and 10 are considered the same combination of the two digits 0 and 1
    - Print only the smallest combination of two digits
    - You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
    You are not allowed to use any variable of type char 

101-print_comb4.c:  Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits.

    - Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
    - The three digits must be different
    - 012, 120, 102, 021, 201, 210 are considered the same combination of the three digits 0, 1 and 2
    - Print only the smallest combination of three digits

    - You are not allowed to use any variable of type char 

102-print_comb5.c: Write a program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.

    - The numbers should range from 0 to 99
    - The two numbers should be separated by a space
